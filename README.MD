Hi professor or TA, whoever grades this. Before you go through grading this I want to let you know that I could not get anything to work. It wasn't out of laziness, disrespect or any malintent, I simply ran out of time between work, personal life and other classes. Sorry that I couldn't finish. I am just submitting this to get whatever points I can.
A little info about the code I built off the project 3 file and around part 7 I think git wasn't letting me merge the branches to master and I did not have time to figure out why 
so that is why the merges stop and the master is simply a version of part 11 that I uploaded. I simply just took the code from the tutorial for each part to try and get any points I could. Sorry it ended it like this but enjoy the rest of your summer.
